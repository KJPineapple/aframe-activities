# A-Frame Activities
Here you can find activities that will help learn how to code WebVR environments using HTML and A-Frame.
You can simply download the whole repository locally or download each file separately from the github website.

In this project, we go over physics, animations, network setup, objects, and basic syntax of HTML and A-Frame.
